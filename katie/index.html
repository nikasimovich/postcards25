        <h5>As I walk down third Avenue in Brooklyn</h5>
        <p>
        I have the feeling that I could be anywhere, in any industrial town, scattered across America and forgotten. I have the feeling that I am elsewhere. There is a reason for this. It starts with the dilapidated, chalky-green highway just above my head.
      </p>

      <p>
      I live at the end of the street, where an on-ramp and avenue clash and merge onto the only interstate-highway in Brooklyn, the BQE. I wake up most mornings to a confusing harmony of honks all shapes and sizes. If there were a word stronger than loathe, than hate, that is how I feel about this noise. But I love living here. I love living on the edge of the neighborhood. I decided to try and capture a sonic and visual journey of the no-mans-land just beyond my apartment, where the noise comes from. Of its particular charm. 
      </p>

      <p>  
      Walking along Third Ave. under the BQE, I observe how nothing is finished being repaired. The avenue is lost in a vortex of disarray because of the highway; the noise, the dirt, the danger, the pollution. Cherry pickers have been abandoned and stored alongside other abandoned cars. Traffic signs and cones point to nothing.

      This place under the highway could be a place to pass by or speed through. That is definitely what it was to Robert Moses, who created this highway system. But still, I like to think of this place like a portal. If you look close enough at the withering parts, there are whole, unique economies and cultures. Some for better or for worse.

        A complete street demolition in 1950 made way for new car lanes, aiding in the construction of the highway. New businesses arrived on the east side of the avenue, which are now mostly auto repair shops. I take photos as I walk: of the rust on the big beams that support the highway, of the facade of the sex and video shops, of a sculpture made of scrap metal parts. The logo of one auto shop is a personified cartoon wheel. It’s flexing its buff arms. I snap of photo of this because it feels symbolic. Out of the existence of the highway came the existence of this very particular place, and to best understand it, one must understand the history of the BQE.
