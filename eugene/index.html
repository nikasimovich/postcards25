      <p>“This doesn’t look like a framed image. It is literally a real world right in front of my eyes.”</p>
      <p> This was my first impression of seeing, my very first photobook ‘Uncommon Places’. Stephen Shore’s photobook struck me differently. I felt something that I could never feel from the digital screen.</p>

        <h5>‘Early Work’ Book Launching at Strand</h5>
        <p>
       Strand Bookstore has stood at the corner of 12th st Broadway, for nearly a century. Its signature red color glows even at the evening. I walked up the stairs, passing the 1st and 2nd floor. When I reach the 3rd floor, the dimness and the smell of the old books invited me.
        </p>
        <p>
       I looked around. I see cameras. Signed books. Anticipation. Concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
       I can hear. His words. Sentences. Past. Memories. Future.
        </p>
         <p>
       I feel wisdom. Honesty. Time. Questions and his answers are floating around the room.

        After the event, I held Early Work in my hands. On its first page, his signature felt like a message:
        </p>
        <p>
          “You’ve finally met the photographer you’ve long wanted to see.”
