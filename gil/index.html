      <h2>Stuyvesant Park in Gramercy is about two half blocks worth of a park with a sidewalk separating the two in the center. While most popular parks in New York City have some form of constant surveillance, the staff taking care of the garden in Stuyvesant shows up sporadically and with no desire to reprimand others. </h2>

        Stuyvesant Park in Gramercy spans two half-blocks, bisected by a sidewalk that creates distinct eastern and western sections. While most popular Manhattan parks <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cutive+Mono&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"><link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="assets/favicon.png">

The park, formally opened in 1850 on four acres of Peter Stuyvesant's former estate, is encircled by New York City's oldest cast-iron fence—an ornate barrier that suggests security while re<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cutive+Mono&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"><link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="assets/favicon.png">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../student.css">ing purely decorative. Though lacking the storied history of other Manhattan parks, Stuyvesant Square hosts a daily theater of urban life that defies its modest appearance. The park's character shifts with its visitors throughout the day. In the morning, medical staff in scrubs from the adjacent hospital claim the benches, their breaks punctuated by the occasional spray of the central fountain. Students from the nearby school spread their work beneath towering trees, while peculiar regulars—like the owner of a leashed pot-bellied pig and an elderly woman with an imposing mop dog—make their daily rounds.    </p>

     The park's wildlife <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cutive+Mono&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"><link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="assets/favicon.png">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../student.css">tains Manhattan's reputation for resilience. A rare sight shows itself in a small hawk that flies overhead, hunting rats that have grown to impressive sizes. Aggressive squirrels, both grey and black varieties, dominate the trees and grass patches, while pigeons compete for territory around the fountain. The fauna here demonstrates nature's adaptation to urban life, each creature displaying a distinctly New York brand of tenacity.

        Unlike the iconic Bethesda Fountain, with its angel statue commemorating the Croton Aqueduct and its sculptor's hidden tribute to her wife, Stuyvesant Park offers a more quotidian slice of Manhattan life. Its charm lies not in grand historical significance but in its role as a stage for the daily drama of city life—medical workers on break, students seeking shade, eccentric dog walkers, and urban wildlife all sharing this iron-fenced sanctuary.

I hear rustling in the bushes behind my feet where I sit. I jump up and see two rats chasing each other into a nearby dark space to hide from my line of sight. This signals that I can no longer stay, and I exit through a fabulous gate, leaving my memories on the bench with the rats.
