        <h5></h5>
        <p>
        
On Friday, September 5th 2025 Brazilian artist Manoela Medeiros hosted a celebratory opening reception for her first solo exhibition in the United States. The event happened at 6pm at Palo Gallery in the East Village.

 </p>
 <p>
On said Friday night, before meeting some friends at a bar, I walked to Palo Gallery by myself to check out the exhibition.

        <h5>The Experience</h5>
        <p>
        It was hot and the space was somewhat small. Like most galleries, the walls were crisp white and lighting intentional. There were people spilling into the street, which created a laid-back, party-like atmosphere. Sidewalk walkers kept peering into the gallery, curious to see why so many people were gathered outside. 
 </p>
 <p>
Inside there was a bucket of ice filled with bottles of wine and beer. Most people were holding plastic cups filled with their beverage of choice. The place felt energetic, with people walking around, and occasionally stopping to admire the work or talk to someone. The artist was present, and she seemed to be beaming with happiness. She was the center of gravity in the room, surrounded by people during the whole time I was there. 
</p>
 <p>
Most of the crowd spoke English, which was a bit surprising to me. I expected to hear more Portuguese. There were people from all ages, including a baby, but most of the demographic were people in their early or late 20s. The people looked cool and interesting.There were a lot of unique outfits, expressive hairstyles, and fashion statement pieces.
</p>
<p>
I walked around the gallery three or four times, and drank two glasses of orange wine. I gave each piece of art the attention that it deserved, making a point in observing it for a thoughtful amount of time.  I didn’t talk to anybody and nobody talked to me. I stood outside for a while and observed the scene, and left after about an hour.

        There was a time when being by myself in public spaces felt uncomfortable, especially when the possibility of small talk hung in the air. It felt good to simply be there for the art, without needing to explain myself or perform anything.

        <h5>The Place</h5>
        <p>
        Palo Gallery sits at 21 E 3rd St, and has a low-key, almost residential presence that fits seamlessly into the neighborhood. It was established in 2018 by Paul Henkel,a third-generation art collector and dealer, and the gallery is committed to championing a diverse and international roster.

        <h5>The Event</h5>
        <p>
       I first heard about this event through the Brazil Arts and Culture Newsletter, which is sent monthly by the Consulate General of Brazil in NY. I subscribed to it last summer, not long after moving to the city, at a time when I was looking for ways to feel more in touch with my nationality. Because the Brazilian expat community here is so large and multifaceted, reconnecting with that part of my identity felt essential.
        </p>
<p>
This exhibition caught my eye for many reasons. Beyond a shared nationality, I was drawn to the fact that Medeiros is a Latin woman working in the art world. Being there for her first exhibition in the United States felt significant and symbolic.
