        Manoela Medeiros’  work is highly defined by methods of excavation and eroding, and it all feels very physical. In the gallery, her philosophy was not only in the paintings and sculptures, but on the walls as well, quite literally. The white walls that surrounded the perimeter had holes and different excavations in them, which made the viewer guess if they were done on purpose or not.

        Upon reading more about her work, I found out that they were indeed intentional. Her wall excavations extend her painting methodology into architecture, transforming clean surfaces into site-specific installations that respond to time and light. It was very cool to see a gallery space so physically transformed by a artist, and I found it intriguing to observe how people reacted to this.

        Because some of the work was in the walls and floor of the gallery, people were unsure of what they could touch and what they couldn’t. It was fascinating to observe how people’s demeanor changed. Some leaned in close to the walls, tracing the indentations with their eyes or fingertips. Others stood awkwardly, afraid to touch or step on anything. The ambiguity of what was art, what was accident, what was trace seemed to ask us to look more carefully, to slow down.
