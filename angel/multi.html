      <p>
      across from the famous washington square park, lies the inconspicuous art gallery 80WSE. this evening marks the beginning of the opening reception for Beetles, Cats, Clouds: The Manga of Tsurita Kuniko, Yamada Murasaki, and Kondoh Akino, showcasing three Japanese women who are pioneers in manga illustrations and challenge traditional gender stereotypes in Japanese comics and culture. their collective works present narratives with nuanced, experimental, and personal perspectives. through illustrations, these women convey vulnerable themes surrounding motherhood, identity, gender, sexuality, and illness.

      my first introduction to graphic novels was through an ethnic studies class in college, where the required reading was exclusively graphic novels. i fell in love. these stories wove compelling visuals with narratives that analyzed the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality. it has always fascinated me the way that art can inspire people to have deeper discussions and consider experiences beyond their own.
      </p>
      <p>
      museums and galleries always leave me with a conflicted feeling. on one hand, they give people the opportunity to explore works that expose them to new ways of seeing, and on the other, the environment sometimes feels like the rigidity that the artwork is pushing against. i am still pondering what the possible alternatives would look like. what is the purpose of a gallery space beyond calling people to recognize the significance of art? what are other ways this process can be replicated?

      if you continue past the first exhibit at 80WSE, you’ll find the glowing cave-like exhibition, Escapements, showcasing the works of Jesse Chun, Taina Cruz, Hamishi Farah, Mark Lombardi, Adam Putman, and Mark Van Yetter. the contrast of the two exhibitions is stark, in both the style of artwork and the atmosphere of the space.

      escapements is an exhibition presenting themes inspired by horology, the study and measurement of time and how it emerges through the human experience. each artists’ work represents an aspect of duality and opposing forces, such as “tensions between heaven and earth, presence and absence, freedom and constraint, and self and society.”

      entering the exhibition, you are immediately consumed by darkness, where each artwork is sparsely placed and glows in its respective corner. as you walk, your eyes are directed to a specific part of the room. and so on and so on.
