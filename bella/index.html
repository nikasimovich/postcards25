<p>I have a thing for liminal spaces; layered spaces where multiple things overlap without interfering with one another. Molasses opens at 11am and closes at midnight seven days a week. At the bar they serve pastries, coffee, tea, wine and beer. At 6pm there’s a change in shift.</p>

       A few things seem at stake: people’s academic paths, spiritual quests, and romantic destinies, depending on who they happen to talk to, or which book they pick up to read.

  <p>Sunday evening is about to begin. The solar eclipse, although invisible from here, has somewhere just ceased to be. I rush home to shower after the Sound of the Cosmos poetry workshop down the street, then I get a slice nearby and park my bike on the metal fence outside. Energized by poetic woosh I am plated in the zest to write. I eat my slice pacing up and down the sidewalk for approximately three minutes before going inside. Grease, I then realize, still lurks in the corners of my mouth. I don’t feel the need to have coffee or tea, and since I decided I don't drink unnecessarily, I get a slice of pumpkin bread, just for the sake of not being rude, since, as the sign says, this isn’t a library.</p>

  <p>The space is small, square shaped. Long tall windows cover both sides of the wooden door, and behind the front glass walls are two wooden C shaped benches with hard edges that contour small tables. Matching red lamps hang from the ceiling over both of these corners. The floor’s also made of wood - actually almost everything is made of wood - including the bookshelves that cover the walls on both sides, the table under the poetry section, the bar in the back, and most of the chairs. I don’t know what the walls are made of, but they’re white, covered in framed paintings, a huge replica of the cover of susan sontag’s against interpretation, and some unframed posters higher up near the ceiling. The “Histomap of History” is glued sideways to the wall near the ceiling above the nine-story alphabetized Lit & Fiction shelves. Behind the bar a back area of undetermined size partialy hides from the main room by a metal-framed hole in the wall of about 5 '2. Candid overlapped polaroids are held in the crevice between the metal frame and the wall.</p>

      <p>Some people come in to draw, sometimes while they also talk. Once, I saw a guy writing a postcard at the bar. I come here mostly alone, except for the nights my friends and I meet here for our Phenomenology reading group. Sometimes there are book readings and magazine launches, and I've been here a few times hoping to just read, to then find myself in some sort of event that packs up the place with aspiring young writers.</p>

      <p>Just a couple of nights ago, on Friday, I meant to just get homework done, and sat in the nook by the window with the rectangular wooden desk pulled so close it was almost pressed against my chest; my feet up in the wooden C-shaped bench. Every time I looked up from my printed reading felt like looking into a timeless snapshot in a film; photographs taken some twenty minutes apart. As I took note of this, a kind-looking short slim woman with black hair and round glasses approached me to say a reading would soon begin, and that the speakers would have to stand in the corner where I was sitting. I moved to the nook on the other side of the door where the light was dimmer and the black round table was made of marble. From there I felt that I could see more of the room, but I am not sure that’s true. The space quickly got fuller, and looking outside I could see my bike. I spoke with a couple of guys, one of them I knew from the reading group - he was there because he was friends with one of the readers that night. The relative quietness of the space made it feel romantically soft. With encounters left to chance, I relieve myself from the burden of choice.</p>

      <p>Outside, next to the entrance, there is a blue plastic box with a transparent lid that says ‘free books’ where free books are stacked. A few foldable metal chairs face the street from the other side of the windows, and a few next to the curb face the inside. From time to time someone will feel the need to smoke, chat, stand or stretch, and step outside.</p>

Molasses is on a list online of ‘best first date spots in NYC’. It is not uncommon to see people meeting for the first time, or just flirting with whoever happens to be here.</div>

      <p>The tea is loose leaf. Wifi password: Molbutts. A guy with cool hand tattoos draws two stools from me. I don’t think I’ve mentioned the top of the bar is a baby shade of green. Most mugs now nap in the hanger above the long metal sink.
      Most of them are white but there is one I really like: grey with blue flowers growing from green leafed stems.
      You could say there isn’t much going on here now, but I like to think about the amount of thoughts being thought every minute, of ideas grasped and stories read. Countless invisibilities linger in this space.
      Right now no one is speaking, and the only voice heard is that of the singer coming from the stereo. The doors creak open and closed, air is moved as pages turn, sounds produced when mugs are put down. The lighter now also makes a sound, as the candles ritualistically begin their daily night shift, after a long (dreamless?) sleep.
      There is a moment of almost complete silence as the barista picks a new album. This time slower, dreamier, more experimental. Some of its sounds seem to be coming from the street, others feel more like a melody. Something changes in the space, and I know that somewhere nearby kids are being put to bed.</p>
