      In September, I went to the soft opening of Haraz Coffee in Fishtown, Philadelphia, which my parents and sister are running (my sister is the pastry chef). Fishtown is a neighborhood in the city drawn in tones of pale gray and blue that once primarily housed a working class population, named for the fishing that was done in the Delaware River. Similar to many deindustrialized neighborhoods in North Philadelphia, sights of urban blight are juxtaposed with coffee shops, restaurants and tattoo parlors with airbrushed signs and often encased in spotless glass walls.  Across the new coffee shop, a McDonald’s with a sizable parking lot stands, its walls painted gray to match the palette of the neighborhood. The Frankford-Market line (colloquially called the ‘EL’ and appearing in blue colors on SEPTA signs) thunders on the tracks looping above the road and cars within a block of the shop.

      Haraz Coffee is a Yemeni coffee shop that started in Michigan, before opening on the East Coast with its first location in Soho, and now opening in Philadelphia. (A coffee shop in West Philadelphia had opened before the branch in Fishtown did.) The sky was blue with tufts of clouds floating in it, and the sunlight was sharp and clear. As I parked my car on the street with the anxiety that it might get a ticket, I noticed how the coffee shop stood in the neighborhood, seamlessly blending in with an atmosphere that was inviting but suggested luxury at the same time. </p>


      <p>

       My mother was dressed in a purple suit with a pink hijab, her lips painted red. Before opening Haraz, she had experience running a boutique tour company that curated trips rooted in culture, sisterhood and a preoccupation with heritage and adventure of a given destination. </p>
     
      <p> “I’m happy to see people are coming here and they’re enjoying themselves. And the space we have created is beautiful, and a good place to gather,” she said. “I came from Pakistan and in our culture, a guest is a blessing to your house. And that’s what I’m teaching my staff as well that any customer who comes in is actually your guest, so treat them with respect and love. And just take care of them.” </p>

       <p>
       Unlike Yemeni coffee shops in New York, the line was not yet out the door, but the coffee shop was still moderately busy, filled mostly with people my family knew and had invited, but also new customers who had come in and were curious to try the extensive menu of coffee and desserts that flashed on a digital screen suspended on the wall behind the counter, or hang out. A white man came in spontaneously in the midst of his jog, briefly checked out the place, then headed back out to finish his run. Croissants, slices of cake, tarts, Dubai chocolate, and savory pastries stuffed with chicken and potato beamed behind the glass on white ceramic trays. An eighteen-or-so-year-old boy with black floppy hair in a brown polo shirt manned the counter alongside my cousin, a tall fourteen-year-old girl with big eyes and lips shaped like a Cupid’s bow.</p>

       <p>  I ordered an iced white mocha latte and a slice of Pistachio milk cake. As I walked further into the shop, settling on a lounge chair of dark brown leather, I noticed that calligraphy in ambient strokes of sea green had been painted on the wall alongside a depiction of Lahore by the artist Zahid Mayo. If the street had been bustling but not noisy outside, the shop vibrated with the chatter of people drinking chai and coffee and celebrating the opening of a new spot in the city. The pistachio milk cake was moist and delectable, the nutty flavor of pistachio cream shooting through my mouth and melding with the sweet, spongy texture of the cake. Finding desserts or coffee made with authentic pistachio and prepared well is difficult, but Haraz truly delivered.</p>
