        There’s music. But it’s the right kind for reading. Soft, ambient, near meditative. The kind that blends with the sounds the sparrows make when they swoop over your head, close enough that if you were to reach up at the right time you might catch one. The music is joined by an orchestra of creaks and cracks from the wooden beach chairs some 100 of us early birds have snatched up before the event formally starts, here in the middle of Hudson Yards.

        We came to read together. Alone, but together. More people than seats, the latecomers lay down blankets and mats and towels in a mote around the chair-bearers. My own lacks the lumbar support I’ve only started needing in the past two years. My spine is a distraction until I remember the rolled up towel I brought thinking I’d be supine on the ground. Shoved between the seat and small of my back, my spine is no longer a distraction. I pull out a book I plan to finish at this event. From looking at the cover you would never know this book is really about Y2K - the title is Fake Work: How I Began to Suspect Capitalism is a Joke. It’s set in New York, and sitting here it feels almost eerie to be reading about a place while you’re in that place. I’ve decided I like eerie.

        Everyone’s facing a stage where the music is emanating, in a traditional audience layout. Sitting at the back I can snoop over shoulders to see what the people in front of me are reading. Or at least I try, the fonts are small. No one is chatting, yet when the hosts announce the first 40 minute segment of reading has begun, it somehow gets quieter still. Just music and September air, the shuffle of confused tourists who normally occupy this space, their iPhones as cameras with the shutter sound effect turned off.

        It’s the type of day where the temperature is perfect in the shade. Halfway through the reading block, the sun that’s pouring over everyone lucky enough to get a seat becomes unbearable. Roasting readers, as if all one body, begin to shift in their seats and the groans from the wood chairs get louder and more frequent. In another minute people are getting up and moving to the shady perimeter. Dragging the loungers, or getting their fingers caught and pinched trying to fold them. Like migrating geese, almost all the chair-bearers have flown to the more forgiving climate under the trees. I try to hold out but I’m not wearing sunscreen and eventually give in. In the shade I can instantly feel the sweat cooling against my skin. Collective relief, the readers quickly resettle and the creaks return to a gentle and sparse coo.
      </p>

        The people who moved are now facing each other in small groups. No longer an audience, we have undergone a type of mitosis and split into small communities. It’s better I think. Now I can see the covers and titles.
