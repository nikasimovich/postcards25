      <p>
      It’s a weekday at The Spaniard in the West Village. What day it is doesn’t really matter.
    </p>
<p>
      The bar is dark, but there’s faint lighting emulating from the candles on tables. They illuminate the glasses filled with overpriced wines and cocktails. There’s an Aperol Spritz at a table that is glowing neon. Its taste is described as bitter and after every sip there is a slight recoil.
</p>
<p>
  While officially a whiskey bar, no one is drinking whiskey. The patrons are the ‘typical’ West Village crowd. Mid-twenties to early thirties, profiled in some New York Magazine article. Dressed in polo shirts, skirts, and the occasional suit.
</p>
<p>The bar is massive. Well, bars. There are four throughout the twists and turns of the establishment. There is even a kitchen. The first bar is loud, extremely loud.
</p>

<p>
  Wandering now, the second bar isn’t as crowded. Still, it is loud and impossible to get a drink. However, there is more space to stand and converse with your friends.
</p>

<p>
  Returning to the first bar, we place our drink order. Overpriced, which is to be expected with going out in New York.
</p>

<p>
  Ice cold drinks in hand, we bypass the second bar and discover the third. Abandoned compared to the first. But nonetheless, still loud.
</p>

<p>
  As the night races towards the next day, The Spaniard becomes busier. The abandoned third bar slowly fills up with people. The tables get filled. The bar becomes crowded.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I have a slight buzz from the neon orange drink mentioned earlier. My focus turns to observing the people of the bar, as I have become bored of the conversation at my table. For a weekday, it's packed. I start to peoplewatch and dramatize the lives of these strangers.
</p>

<p>
  Soon I am thwarted by the noise (and the liquor). I can’t concentrate and I keep losing my train of thought.
</p>

<p>
  It’s loud. Not just from the conversations of the patrons, but from the clinging of glasses. There’s the sound of ice in the cocktail shaker. The splash of a pour. Faint music, slight smacking from someone chewing, and also the traffic from outside.
</p>

<p>
The sounds of the bar are overwhelming and you can’t really hear your own conversation, much less anyone else’s. Maybe that’s part of the appeal.
</p>

<p>
It gets louder and louder as it gets later in the evening. It’s so loud. The clanging of glasses increases. The conversations get louder. The music somehow gets louder. Louder, louder, louder.
</p>

<p>
And then finally, a glass shatters.
</p>

<p>
The bar becomes silent for a split second.
</p>

<p>
The noise then resumes.
</p>

<p>
As you exit, the street at midnight has more direct lighting than the inside of The Spaniard. Maybe that’s part of the appeal.
</p>
