        As I get closer to the memorial, the roar of rushing water drowns out the excited murmur of tourists and subdues the cities otherwise continuous commotion. My noisy thoughts are likewise tamed; they are no longer racing to make connections, but saunter from idea to idea. Amidst constant activity, calmness is uncanny. This is the first absence of the memorial: the penitent hush of tragedy.

        The second is the visual affront of the pools: they cannot be filled. Infinity pools give the illusion of abundance; the body of water you sit in continues to the horizon. Here, no horizon or point of reference is to be found. Stretching onto the tips of your toes, you are still unable to find the bottom of the abyss into which the water falls. In your stomach, a pit of anger and frustration opens as you are confronted with your own inadequacy.

        The third absence comes from the names on the memorial. Sheets of blackened bronze wrap themselves around the edge of the nearly acre sized pools. Wrapping with them are the names of the two thousand nine hundred and eighty-three people killed in both the 2001, and 1993 attacks. While the sites of their passing protrude from the memorial, the names themselves are stamped out of the bronze. They are marked by their very absence. Precisely what this means is that, while you run you finger along the name of a stranger contemplating who they were or recall fond memories of the named loved one, you physically fill the void of their name.

        Because of this absence, you define it. It is your thoughts, memories, feelings, and physical presence which fill the bounded emptiness of the site. Including, potentially, thoughts, memories, and feelings about those who died in the aftermath. American and not.

      Atop a man-made hill south of the memorial pools sits Liberty Park and a Church which shines white at night. On a bench in the park, I stare blankly across the street at the memorial pools as I fidget with the brochures for Saint Nicholas, a Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine. I’m not religious, though I’ve been baptized. Still, I’m drawn to it. I cannot read the words of Jesus on the cross — “My god, my god, why have you forsaken me”—without feeling a conflicting current of emotion shoot through me, a sudden urge to yell.  
      </p>

      I entered the church three quarters of an hour earlier feeling compelled, when I came across the optional donation terminal, to give a few dollars. In spite of, or rather, because of the resonant solemnity of the Byzantine chanting playing through a series of speakers, the church feels eerily silent, as if awaiting something. Like the pools, there is a pregnant emptiness. I take a seat in the back left corner and listen.

        Saint Nicholas was the only building outside of the world trade center complex to be destroyed in the NY attacks on 9/11. On the consecration of the newly built church two decades later, it was declared to be “a place for everyone who comes to the Sacred Ground at the World Trade Center, a place for them to imagine and envision a world where mercy is inevitable, reconciliation is desirable, and forgiveness is possible.”

        While I sit in the Church, I see multiple such people. As each of them comes in, I watch them meekly make their way to a seat before bowing their heads. So as not to disturb others, they muffle their sobs before sitting erect, wiping their tears, and leaving to continue with their day. One, however, stays around much longer. He’s young, likely in his late teens, and has a fashion sense reminiscent of popular tiktokers: a long-textured crop, jeans, and Jordans. Unlike popular tiktokers, he is shy, doing his best not to disturb others while he meanders awestruck. As he begins to venerate the stained-glass icons of saints at the front of the church, he is overcome. Sobs turn into weeps, and I can’t help but feel that this is what the silence was waiting to be filled with.

      Whatever his reasons, I wonder if this is it what would it look like for that consecratory ethos to be realized: penitence for an anger fueled by a desire to fill a hole left by grief and meaninglessness. Hoping to learn I buy a small green booklet entitled “Love Your Enemies.” It comes with a bookmark, “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.”
      </p>

      As I exit, still skeptical of Church, its political history and usage, I pray, “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner, so that I may be part of this shinning city up on the hill more spacious than the heavens.”
