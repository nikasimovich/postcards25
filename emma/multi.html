        Why does it feel awkward and mildly scary every time I enter into an unknown space alone?
      <p>
      I’m used to this. I do this, not infrequently, at least. I settle myself with a breath as I approach. <span class="italic">It’s literally just another underfunded comedy club.</span> We’ve been here before. Not, here, but we know this environment. If anything, these spaces are supposed to be the most welcoming of environments. Safe spaces. Places of humor, community.

<h5>Yes, and?</h5>
        <p>
        I’m waiting in the lobby. I’ve pre-purchased my ticket, which delights the receptionist. His response tells me I’m the only one who did. We’re waiting until the theater opens. Two separate groups of folks are chatting. I’m very aware I’m the only person alone in this room, but I’m consciously okay with it. Mostly. It still feels weird. <span class="italic">I</span> still feel weird. The pictures and advertisements on the wall make me think this is a space for groups, for people to gather, for community to grow, and somehow my isolated presence feels very incompatible with the environment. I turn my attention further to the walls and other inanimate surroundings.
        <h4> The atrium feels only a few steps removed from a multi-purpose room, but that feels standard of these places. The uncommitted interior design aids in my feeling of unease. The fluorescent lights feel too bright, too revealing, but I have nothing to hide so I’m not sure why I feel this way. The shortcomings of this room do, however, seem to reinforce the main objective of these kinds of places—to create in the void. The goal is not a product, but the furthering of creativity, the bringing about of community, the procuring of understanding, joy, and craft.</h4
        >
        </p>
        I wonder why I’m leaning toward being judgmental, and I think how if I had a friend with me, I’d likely be making them laugh in conversation, unaware of the coldness alone-me currently feels in the room.

        One of the groups of chatting folk left—they were leftovers from the earlier show, still chatting—, but they've been replaced by a new group of four. Another couple joins shortly before showtime, and I get the sense at least some members of each of the three parties present are performers or have other ties to this venue; perhaps they take one of the many classes advertised on the atrium walls. 
        <p>
        <h4>The show tonight is one that has been happening for almost eight years now called <a href="https://www.youarenotalone.show/">“You Are Not Alone: An Uplifting Show about Depression”</a> where comics share stories related to their mental health struggles, which get turned into scene work and jokes meant to bring levity and community back into these spaces usually occupied by darkness. This almost seems redundant as the Venn diagram between comics and mental health struggles seem largely circular.</h4>

        I entered the theater with an open and compassionate mind and leave the same. The show feels unremarkable and frankly not that entertaining. I don’t think any less of the performers — I’ve been in similarly shaped shoes. I’ve tried improv; I’ve failed publicly. I admire their conviction even in the absence of anything remarkable on stage. Is it not remarkable enough for this event to take fruition?
      
        <h4>The entire evening my mind has wandered to the walls, the space enclosed within. Has this place always existed?</h4>

          My mind is captured by the ghosts of all the people who were here yesterday and every Sunday before this one and who might be here later this week. Living in an urban environment contains this eerie quality of vastness and smallness, of isolation and infinitesimal community. To be alone, surrounded.
          <p>
              I determine the show, perahps in an inadvertent way, has reminded me I am not alone, but I do feel lonelier. This city still feels like a world in which I am not a part. I guess I'm still waiting to be absorbed into its membrane.
            </p>
          <h4> As I walk home, the island of Manhattan expands frantically, each block containing its own microcosm of the city, each building with its own set of loud, generous, obnoxious, and hot neighbors. Each apartment witnesses its own course of life, and I feel them all, briefly. The world outside somehow feels even larger than it did  when I was walking to the theater or commuting on the subway earlier. </h4>
            <h5> Next Sunday will have a new cast and a different show.</h5>
