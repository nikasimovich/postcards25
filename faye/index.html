      <b> <span class="caps"> MAGIC 8 SALON IS EXPERIMENTAL. </span> That means you don’t have to be polished, you don’t have to be experienced, and you don’t have to have a full plan. </b> 
      <p>
        It’s in front of an audience, but most of the crowd will be your friends. Or friends of friends. Or friends of friends of friends. 
        <p>
        The salon, curated and hosted by best friends Phoebe and Peyton, is part talent show and part freak show. And I mean that in the best way. After all, I was one of the performers. And I may help organize future events with them, too. I'm especially excited to be a part of the salon after the energy, freedom, <span class = "caps"> SKILL </span> and fun on Sept. 5th. 
<p> 
  As a journalist who writes about sexuality, I'd say: <i> In a cultural landscape rife with stigma (anti-queer, anti-trans, anti-sexual expression, and pro-conformity), it's nice to have a space for all sorts of young artists. </i> But as an amateur performer and a party girl, I'd just say it was nice to spend a Friday night screaming at the top of my lungs as my friends showed off their cool talents.
