Dance Data Underground Fanzine is an archive of the present day in DIY underground music. The second issue peels back the visual architects who’ve molded the look and feel of the scene. A design index showcases prolific flyers, album covers, and other objects from the last two decades. Comprised of 144 pages, this edition is safe to say it is their best yet. The release of Issue #2 occurred at Dear Friend Books in Bed-Stuy, known to have a curated list of publications focused on design.       </p>

  The people in attendance knew what they were getting into, and were excited to look through the content of the print. Listening to the conversations sprouting around the space was inspiring, as the creatives who set up the publication were present and open to have commentary on this issue and talks of future releases with their collective. Pairing these conversations with the creative flyers and typography left the attendee with a wave of inspiration, looking forward to what the collective had in store for the second part of the event.

  After the issue release at Dear Friend Books, the renegade was scheduled to be at a warehouse studio in Williamsburg. The event had a stacked bill with all of the DJs playing sourced vinyl covering the bases of Techno and Acid music. Upon arriving to the street where the warehouse was located, we were met with crowds of people conversing and exchanging vices with the sound system bumping through the atmosphere. We were ready to join in and tune into the music.

  As the night progressed, the space grew louder and the people kept coming. As it grew past 2AM we saw the peak amount of people enjoying music and dancing freely. This event felt different than previous events attended in the name of dance music. No one was sitting to the side taking videos, or on their phone, which really stumps the mood of the dance floor. Everyone seemed to be in attendance not for status or because it was the ‘hot’ event of the night, everyone was there to dance and to let loose for the sake of letting loose. It felt as if we were in attendance with the right people.
