            <h5>Backround</h5>
      <p>
        <span class="italic">Dance Data Underground Fanzine</span> is an archive of the present day in DIY underground music. The second issue peels back the visual architects who’ve molded the look and feel of the scene. A design index showcases prolific flyers, album covers, and other objects from the last two decades. Comprised of 144 pages, this edition is safe to say it is their best yet.
      </p>
      <p> Archiving within the Electronic Music scene is largely done in online spaces, through collective work across space and time. Although this is approachable to the modern era of communication, collaborations like Dance Data stand out amidst the many collectives through its preferred medium of print. It may not reach as far as online spaces do, but for those who partake within the scene, this is a unique experience that enhances the preservation of the times through championing artists that have made the scene what it is today.

            <h5>Zine Release</h5>

<p> The first portion of the Dance Data event began at <a href="https://www.dearfriendbooks.com/">Dear Friend Books</a> in Bed-Stuy. This is a beautiful space for a publication release as it is intimate, and curated with the intention to make the consumer feel as if they were properly invited to this event. On days when events are not being hosted, you can find curated publications offering photography and design books.
</p>
<p>Although this event was open to the public, the only way of being in the know revolved around flyers made for the release, posted around Brooklyn. With this being said, the turnout was a success and brought a diverse crowd of people together with the intention to preserve the DIY scene and to highlight those who work within it.
</p>
<p>The people in attendance seemingly knew what they were getting into, and were excited to look through the content of the print.  A few people were sipping tea with the staff of Dear Friends, and others gathered around to look through the zine cover-to-cover.
</p>
<p>The creatives who worked on the publication were all present, and those who were inspired by the release were able to pick their brains about how they felt about finally being able to showcase the work, and what was in store for the next issue. The commentary that stemmed from these interactions were inspirational to witness, as it seemed to be a wholesome and exciting transaction of knowledge given by people who have supported the DIY scene for years, and for those who are wanting to learn what they can about it.

            <h5>Renegade</h5>
<p>After the issue release at Dear Friend Books, the renegade was scheduled to be at a warehouse studio in Williamsburg. The event had a stacked bill with all of the DJs playing sourced vinyl covering the bases of Techno and Acid music. Upon arriving to the street where the warehouse was located, we were met with crowds of people conversing and exchanging vices with the sound system bumping through the atmosphere. We were ready to join in and tune into the music.
</p>
<p>Once the group I attented with established we were ready to head in, we walked through the ticketed area and were met by the same artists from Dear Friend Books, who comprised of Dance Data. They were working the booth where they were selling extra copies of the second issue. This made it feel as if this renegade was offering more than dance music, as it celebrated the artists who worked on the zine by giving them a space to enjoy the show and to make some more money selling zines.

        The atmosphere was guided by fast-paced beats and heavy synth waves, creating a space for every person in attendance to be guided by the rhythm.

<p>We danced until we couldn’t, and did not give a damn about the time or how we were going to get home. The music took over, and the night had been laid out before us. Our only way of tapping back into reality was the switching of the DJs, and there were 5 on the bill. 
</p>      
<p>As the night progressed, the space grew louder and the people kept coming. As it grew past 2AM we saw the peak amount of people enjoying music and dancing freely. This event felt different than previous events attended in the name of dance music. No one was sitting to the side taking videos, or on their phone, which really stumps the mood of the dance floor. Everyone seemed to be in attendance not for status or because it was the ‘hot’ event of the night, to me, everyone was there to dance and to let loose for the sake of letting loose. It felt as if we were in attendance with the right people, for the right reasons.
